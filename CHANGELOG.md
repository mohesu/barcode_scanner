## 6.0.1

**BREAKING CHANGES BY [MOBILE_SCANNER](https://pub.dev/packages/mobile_scanner):**

```
- [iOS] iOS 15.5.0 is now the minimum supported iOS version.
- [iOS] Updates MLKit to version 7.0.0.
- [iOS] Updates the minimum supported XCode version to 15.3.0.

Improvements:

- [MacOS] Added the corners and size information to barcode results.
- [MacOS] Added support for `analyzeImage`.
- [MacOS] Added a Privacy Manifest.
- [web] Added the size information to barcode results.
- [web] Added the video output size information to barcode capture.
- Added support for barcode formats to image analysis.
- Updated the scanner to report any scanning errors that were encountered during processing.
- Introduced a new getter `hasCameraPermission` for the `MobileScannerState`.
- Fixed a bug in the lifecycle handling sample. Now instead of checking `isInitialized`,
  the sample recommends using `hasCameraPermission`, which also guards against camera permission errors.
- Updated the behavior of `returnImage` to only determine if the camera output bytes should be sent.
- Updated the behavior of `BarcodeCapture.size` to always be provided when available, regardless of `returnImage`.
- [iOS] Excluded the `armv7` architecture, which is unsupported by MLKit 7.0.0.
- Added a new `onDetectError` error handler to the `MobileScanner` widget, for use with `onDetect`.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed a bug that would cause the scanner to emit an error when it was already started. Now it ignores any calls to start while it is starting.
- [MacOS] Fixed a bug that prevented the `anaylzeImage()` sample from working properly.
- Fixed a bug that would cause onDetect to not handle errors.
